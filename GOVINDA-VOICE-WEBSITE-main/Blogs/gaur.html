                    <h2>GAUR PURNIMA - APPEARENCE DAY OF MAHAPRABHU</h2>
                </div>

                <div class="main">
                    <p>Sri Gaura Purnima is the auspicious appearance day of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, also known as Gauranga due to His golden complexion.  As stated in the scriptures, the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna appeared as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and taught the importance of devotion to Lord Krishna through congregational chanting of the holy names of God, known as the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. He appeared on Phalguni Purnima, the full moon day in Phalguna (Feb-March) in 1486 AD (1407 Shakabda) at Sridham Mayapur as the son of Sri Jagannath Mishra and Srimati Sachidevi. His parents named Him Nimai since He was born under a Nimba (neem) tree in the courtyard of His paternal house. This festival also marks the beginning of the New Year for Gaudiya Vaishnavas.</p>
                    <br>
                   
                    <p>The celebrations begin with a Pallakki Utsava of Sri Sri Nitai Gauranga (Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Lord Nityananda). The Utsava Deities are carried for a procession in a Pallakki bedecked with flowers amidst grand kirtans. After the procession, the Deities of Nitai Gauranga receive a grand abhisheka. Their Lordships are first bathed with panchamrita and then with panchagavya, followed by various fruit juices. Devotees chant prayers from the Brahma-Samhita, glorifying the Lord. A grand arati is performed to the accompaniment of the Gaura arati, a song composed by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura. After the arati, the Deities are bathed with sanctified water from 108 kalashas while the devotees chant the Purusha Sukta prayers. Their Lordships then receive pushpa vrishti (showering of fragrant flowers) and a special offering of 56 dishes (chappan bhog)</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After the abhisheka, a Shayana arati is performed by singing Sri Sachi Tanayashtakam, which describes His transcendental form, qualities and activities. The program concludes with the Shayana Pallakki Utsava.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Devotees at HALDIA VOICE, will conduct a Harinama Nagara Sankirtana from 5.30 PM to 6.15 PM for all the residents in and around the temple premises honouring the spiritual teachings of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, congregational chanting of Hare Krishna Mahamantra.</p>
